```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4"></div>
</div>
```This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a flex container with two divs. The first div has a red background and takes up half the width, while the second div has a blue background and takes up the remaining half. However, if you add content to the second div that exceeds the available width, it will overflow and break the layout.
